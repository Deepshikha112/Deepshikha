//Q1-Look up java plugin documentation. Make changes in manifest to make it executable with correct class. 
// When run using java -jar JAR_NAME_HERE the output should be text "Hello World" on the console.

//Q2-look up idea plugin. make changes in build.gradle so that the sources of src/main/java as well as src/main/java2 are taken as sources. 
// Ensure that when you make JAR file class files in both are added to the JAR.
// This will teach you how projects with non-conventional structure can be used with gradle.

//Q3-add 2 files file1.xml and file1.txt in src/main/resources manually. 
// make changes so that when creating jar only file1.xml is added to the jar.

//Q5-Find a maven repository and add it as a repository. You can use bintray, jcenter
repositories {
    jcenter()
    maven {
        url "https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.jetbrains.kotlinx/kotlinx-coroutines-core"
